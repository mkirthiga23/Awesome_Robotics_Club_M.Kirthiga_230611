Exploring Mars through autonomous rover navigation is fascinating due to The challenge of creating intelligent systems to navigate the Red Planet's diverse terrain autonomously inspires innovation at the intersection of robotics, AI, and space exploration. Additionally, I was also participating in one of the funfilled events of the Robotics Club , The Robothon. It was so fascinating thinking and bringing up solutions and building a Sumo Robot  , funfilled and provided a great arena to learn to the fullest along with the team. I am more excited for this project bcos of the fun in the club along with the excitement that space talks gives me
